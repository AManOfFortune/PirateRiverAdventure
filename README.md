# üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Pirate River Adventure üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

This is a simple OpenGL puzzle adventure game developed using parts of the [Game-Engine series of The Cherno](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT&si=Z61h1MRwqmiLKk_n). It was developed as a university assignment for the "Computergraphics & Mixed Reality" course at the FH Technikum Vienna.

## How to play
The goal of the game is making the small boat escape from the river into the open sea and collecting all the treasure on the way.

To control, use the `WASD` keys to control the boat, and the `ARROW` keys to control the camera. After collecting all the treasure in a level, head to the exit marked with a red X and the next level will load. Should you get killed by a monster, the current level will reload.

After completing all levels, the first level gets loaded again and you can play again! :)
